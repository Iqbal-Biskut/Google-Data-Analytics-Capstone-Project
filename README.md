# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Car Sales Case Study

## Introduction:

This is the Capstone Project for my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Course. For this case study, instead of using a dataset provided by Google in the course, I decided to challenge myself and use a different dataset I got from Kaggle. The raw dataset, made by Suraj520, can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/car-sales-data/discussion/406644)

## Scenario:

- I am a junior data analyst working for a business intelligence consultant. I have been tasked to lead a project for a fictional car dealership franchise.
- The stakeholder has requested me to analyze car model sales, evaluate salesperson performance, and identify sales trends according to the data they have gathered from 1st of May 2022 to 1st of May 2023.

## Method:

- For this project, due to the large CSV file size, I couldn't directly use Microsoft Excel or Google Big Query to clean and analyze the data
- Therefore I decided to learn and use Microsoft SQL Server for this project. My whole SQL query from exploration, cleaning and correction can be found [here](https://github.com/Iqbal-Biskut/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project/blob/main/CarSalesDataSQLQuery.sql)
- Documentations are provided inside the query for ease of comprehension

## Other Methods:

- After exploration and cleaning in Microsoft SQL Server, I split the CSV file into five smaller files according to the respective financial quarters
- Reformatted the files to XLSX and analyzed using Pivot Tables in Microsoft Excel
- Finally I created visualizations in Tableau which can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/iqbal.halid/viz/GoogleCapstoneProject_16874171849530/Sheet6)
- The whole completed project, where I explained my thought process and techniques used is presented here
